# Overview

As a software engineer eager to advance my skills, I've developed a GIS map application focusing on Rexburg, Idaho. This project aims to provide an interactive map showcasing 20 different locations within Rexburg.

The primary purpose behind developing this software was to gain practical experience in GIS development and to understand the integration of geographical data into web applications.

# Development Environment

The software was developed using basic web development tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The core functionality of the GIS map was implemented using JavaScript.

# Useful Websites

During the development process, the following websites proved to be highly helpful:

* [ArcGIS Documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/tutorials/): ArcGIS provided essential functionality for creating interactive maps.
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/): W3Schools served as a valuable resource for referencing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Future Work

There are several areas for potential improvement and future additions to this GIS map software:

* Implementing search functionality to allow users to locate specific addresses or landmarks efficiently.
* Enhancing the user interface for better interactivity and improved user experience.
* Integrating additional map layers such as terrain or satellite imagery to provide more comprehensive visualization.
* Adding support for mobile devices to ensure accessibility across different platforms.
